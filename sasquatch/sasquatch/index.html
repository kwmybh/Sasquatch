            <p class="text-left"><span id="drop-cap">A</span>t night, in the valley in Guernsey County, Ohio, Bea Mills took a thermal imaging scope and pointed it toward the pond. Through the scope, she saw two heat-map outlines that were
              obviously deer bending down to drink from the water. She asked the other searcher, “What’s that third thing?” The third thing, a blob, had stood up and started walking away.
              <br><br>
              The figure disappeared, and the larger group was alerted. They started watching the forest and Mills was the only one looking in her direction. She saw tree trunks and nothing else. Then one of the trunks began moving. It became a
              silhouette that looked like a very fit football player with broad shoulders and thin hips. It walked toward her, casually.
              <br><br>
              In fear, she hid her face in her hands. Then she heard what sounded like an elephant crashing through briars, brambles, and water. The others also heard it too, but no one else saw the creature. But Mills can’t unsee what she saw.
              “After that moment, I decided I have no other rational explanation for this,” Mills says. It had to be Sasquatch.

            <p class="text-left"><span id="drop-cap">I</span>n October 1967, rodeo cowboy Roger Patterson and his friend Bob Gimlin were amateur filmmakers working in the forest in Northern California. During their trip, Patterson saw something
              walking in the distance and captured about a minute of shaky footage from a rented 16mm movie camera. The footage showed a hairy human-like figure that was later estimated to be more than seven feet tall. It was very muscular and
              appeared to have human-like breasts.
              <br><br>
              It has been 50 years since that footage now known as the Patterson-Gimlin film was released. For enthusiasts, it has become a keystone piece of evidence of the existence of Sasquatch. One scientist speculates that the
              Patterson-Gimlin film is perhaps the most analyzed piece of footage behind the Zapruder film of President John Kennedy’s assassination.
              <br><br>
              The film, however, is not the first piece of evidence. In 1889, Col. Garrick Mallery, who studied Native American picture writing, discovered line drawings at Painted Rock in Central California. The red, black, white and yellow
              artwork depicts wildlife ranging from centipedes to frogs to coyotes and bears. Aside from these animals, the scene also includes an 8-and-a half-feet high figure known as “Hairy Man.” The Yokuts tribes in the area whose ancestors
              created the drawings also have a legend about how each animal taught humans something unique. The Hairy Man taught humans to walk upright. In 1994, an audio recording in Columbiana County, Ohio near the Ohio River, captured a
              mournful, repeating, moaning yell that became known as the “Ohio Howl.”
              <br><br>
              The Bigfoot Field Research Organization (BFRO) is perhaps the most active organized group looking for Sasquatch in North America. They research reported sightings and interview witnesses. The BFRO discounts a vast majority of the
              claims, but the ones deemed legitimate are recorded in the BFRO sighting database. In 2013, a researcher at Penn State, compiled a data map from more than 3,000 BFRO reported sightings from 1921 to 2012. The Ohio River Valley is
              particularly dense with sightings, as is the Pacific Northwest and Central Florida.
              <br><br>
              Marc DeWerth, the Ohio curator for BFRO and founder of the Ohio Bigfoot Conference, had heard of Sasquatch since he was a child. His grandfather told him they were real, and he believed. DeWerth began looking for Bigfoot and in 1998,
              in the Salt Fork region of Ohio, he saw something.

              was a hoax or a real encounter. Believers point to Hollywood film experts who say this level of makeup and special effects wasn’t possible more than 50 years ago. Skeptics ask why there hasn’t been other videos or photo evidence,
              especially with the increased use of trail cameras and more amatuer photographers than ever before. Neither side has been able to prove their point.

            <p class="text-left"><span id="drop-cap">M</span>arc DeWerth was at a deer check station near the Salt Fork State Park in Ohio at the end of hunting season in 1996. He handed out his Bigfoot investigator cards to people who might have
              seen something in the forest. A couple of hunters told DeWerth they hadn’t seen a Sasquatch, but if he was interested in other unusual animals, they had seen a badger den. Badgers are not common in Ohio, and DeWerth was curious. The
              next year, he followed the hunters’ directions and drove to the end of an isolated dirt road, and walked more than a mile into the forest before he found the den. On the way back, he heard steps crunching in the underbrush behind
              him. At first, he thought it was a bobcat or even a cougar.

              <i class=""> Marc Dewerth with a replica of a plaster cast of a Sasquatch footprint</i>

              <br><br>

              Today, DeWerth is the curator for the Bigfoot Field Research Organization in Ohio. He is also the co-founder of the Ohio Bigfoot Conference held at the Salt Fork State Park in Guernsey County, in Ohio. He is well known among Bigfoot
              enthusiasts in the Midwest.
              <br><br>
              His personal experience convinced DeWerth Sasquatch is real but made him more suspicious of other Sasquatch sightings. A person who is giddy about their encounter probably isn’t legit because Sasquatch is terrifying. DeWerth
              questions each detail. “If you don’t keep your ‘skepticals’ on, you’re not looking properly into the evidence presented,” he says.
              <br><br>
              More than 20 years ago when he first began talking to groups about Sasquatch, DeWerth says his typical audience was about 15 people. When he asked if anyone believed in Sasquatch, maybe one person would reluctantly put up their hand.
              It’s different now. On a recent weekend, DeWerth was scheduled to speak at a public library, and the staff there expected at least 100 people. DeWerth founded the Ohio Bigfoot Conference in 2012, and it has drawn overflow crowds at
              the Salt Fork Lodge in Ohio. Celebrity speakers have included Cliff Barackman, the host of the Animal Planet reality show “Finding Bigfoot.” He spends his free time speaking about Sasquatch and setting up audio recorders that sit for
              weeks in the Ohio forests to capture the creature’s screams. He also leads several hikes a year for groups wanting to search for Sasquatch. Based on his recent experiences, the majority of people interested in Sasquatch today are
              absolute believers, even if they have never gone into the woods.

                of nothing. As an adult, Mills was still outdoors as much as possible and looking for things to do with other nature lovers. Curious, she went to a Bigfoot Conference as a joke but liked the people there and began to go on searches
                with them.
                On April 6, 2014, when Mills and others went back to the location where they had seen the mysterious figure through a thermal scope, she was still the skeptic. Mills was having fun, singing out loud as she often did, and wasn’t
                taking anything too seriously. Then there was a call on the radio: “You need to get down here.”
                Mills kept singing, and her friend waved a glow stick as they hiked down into a valley near a shallow pond. When they met the others, everyone else was quiet.

                <br><br>
                “He’s here,” one of them whispered.
                <br><br>
                “Who’s here?” Mills asked.
                <br><br>
                “Squatch is here.”

                She almost started laughing. But she joined the group and looked into the forest. It was a clear night, with a bright moon. She saw the silhouettes of trees that hadn’t leafed out yet. Then she saw the shape of a creature moving
                toward her.
                Since then, Mills has studied biology and nature to learn more about the forest and, like DeWerth, she’d require substantial evidence before considering someone’s description of a Sasquatch encounter. She also knows that her own
                experience, without evidence, wouldn’t pass her validity test.
                “I know what I saw was completely surreal and burned into my brain,” Mill says. “But it’s just a story.”

                  <p class="text-left"><span id="drop-cap">T</span>he classroom on the ground floor of Irvine Hall at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio is like every other college science lab: long tables instead of desks, office chairs on rollers and
                    a
                    tile floor that is easy to clean in case of spills from experiments. Mismatched storage cabinets on one wall hold equipment and specimens while a glass-door display on the other wall showcases shells, bleached coral and a bear
                    skull.
                    <br><br>
                    This is a forensic biology class and the instructor, Dr. Scott Moody, is going over palynology, the study of pollens. Many of the 26 students in the class are working toward careers in forensics, and Moody’s case studies include
                    how
                    various gruesome murders were solved by examining minuscule spores through a microscope. He first taught this course at Ohio University in Athens about 25 years ago. In one of those classes, a student asked him if he had he ever
                    looked
                    into Sasquatch.
                    <br><br>
                    “That’s a bunch of nuts running around imagining things,” Moody recalls telling him. The young man suggested the professor read a book by a former newspaper publisher John Green who had been researching Sasquatch since the late
                    1950s.
                    Moody was skeptical, but he was also curious. Though he was busy with teaching, the professor began reading.
                    <br><br>
                    The research changed his perspective. When someone asks Moody today if he believes in Sasquatch, he says he believes instead in the scientific method. The first step in the method is to ask a question but many scientists skip to
                    an
                    answer: Sasquatch doesn’t exist.
                    Moody readily admits it is easy to debunk most evidence. “Sasquatch” hair samples he examines under microscopes turn out to be from deer or wolverine. Audio recordings of screams analyzed by other researchers are almost always
                    screech
                    owls or the especially chilling sound of a red fox screaming.
                    <br><br>
                    But fakes don’t disprove all claims, Moody says. There are things that can’t be explained. Current science makes it reasonable to consider an “uncategorized species” in the woods. For instance, tracks have been found that appear
                    to
                    be
                    from primates on two feet that include hard-to-fake dermal ridges—those bumps that make up our own fingerprints.
                    <br><br>
                    Lack of evidence or false results don’t dampen Moody’s interest. Years ago, when that student first suggested he look into Sasquatch, he was 100 percent sure the stories were baloney. Today, the biologist sees it differently.
                    “I’m
                    100
                    percent certain that there is a species out there for which we do not have proof,” Moody says.
                    <br><br>
                    Dr. Steven Krichbaum, a herpetologist who took classes under Moody at Ohio University, says the professor teaches students to think broadly and to question things, whatever that might be. “He is a hardcore scientist, and an
                    excellent
                    teacher, and somewhat of an iconoclast,” Krichbaum says.
                    Krichbaum also believes there could be something in the forest that science hasn’t identified. Krichbaum says an archeologist friend of his saw a large hairy ape-like creature walking nearby, and she didn’t know what it was, but
                    she
                    was sure it wasn’t a bear—a common explanation for a Sasquatch sighting.
                    <br><br>
                    “If that’s the case, then maybe people are mistaking Sasquatches for bears too,” Krichbaum says. “It would have to work both ways.”

                    <p class="text-left"><span id="drop-cap">P</span>rofessional biologists comprise a small contingent of Bigfoot researchers. Most others, such as previous fifth-grade science teacher and jazz guitarist Cliff Barackman, got
                      involved with research because of their passion. Barackman, the host of Animal Planet's “Finding Bigfoot,” has a special interest in the castings of large footprints that some believe are the most reliable evidence of
                      Bigfoot. Others argue that the footprints are easy to fake and that they are the most common hoaxes.
                      <br><br>

                      Barackman, however, says that casts from over the years are very similar.
                      <br><br>
                      “The 1958 footprint was in California. Northern California. The 2018 November footprint was in Colton Oregon. But yet, hundreds and hundreds of miles apart, decades apart, cast by different people, but yet they show the
                      same features,” Barackman says. “That really should not be the case if this thing is all made up.”
                      <br><br>
                      Other researchers have seen the consistencies. Dr. Wolf Fahrenbach in Oregon analyzed measurements from plaster casts of more than 700 Sasquatch footprints collected across 40 years from the Pacific Northwest and Western
                      Canada. He found the median length of a footprint was about 16 inches long and longest was 27 inches. For comparison, a men’s size 17 shoe is only 13 inches long.
                      <br><br>
                      While footprint casts exist, skeptics can also point to an absence of evidence: there hasn’t been a Sasquatch body found, dead or alive. Barackman counters that this should be expected. He estimates that five Bigfoots die
                      every 10 years. Bodies do not last long in the wilderness with flies, birds and other scavengers around and with normal decomposition. A Sasquatch body wouldn’t last long in the forest, he says.

              <p class="text-left"><span id="drop-cap">T</span>here is a true mystery behind Sasquatch. People are curious beings, and the idea that a creature such as Sasquatch may be living among everyday humans is truly a thrill. What
                seems to be
                true (or not true) has been debated over and over in, not only the general public, but in popular culture as well. The beginning of the search for Sasquatch began once the first sighting was reported in California, and it
                accelerated
                quite rapidly after that New discoveries, sightings, and evidence have further allowed people to look deeper into the possibility that Sasquatch could maybe exist, and popular culture has continued developing their own
                thoughts that
                we
                see every day.
                <br><br>
                More popular and more public, movies and TV shows depict Sasquatch in a much more personified way. Movies that reference a Sasquatch-like figure date back to 1964. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, a classic Christmas movie,
                created a
                snowmonster that lived in the mountains, similar to where people believe Sasquatch would live. The references to the creature in these TV shows and movies show that the lack of evidence behind his existence doesn’t hinder
                people from
                imagining what he would look like, and how he would act.

                <br><br>
                On the other side of popular culture, simple pop culture elements of Sasquatch are seen in niche places, such as wood carving and statues. The figure doesn’t speak, and doesn’t have a relationship with any humans or animals.
                People
                carve and create to allow them to decide what the creature looked like. Their end products are for them and others with the same beliefs as them, and it’s a way to visualize what Sasquatch may look like, regardless of whether
                they’ve
                witnessed him or not.

                <br><br>

                Below is a photo gallery that shows the differences between how people depict Sasquatch. Look at the differences between the wood carvings and the animated movies.

                  There are many Bigfoot enthusiast groups in the Ohio region. Events for Bigfoot speakers at local libraries or state park lodges are common. At one such meeting on a Friday evening In February 2019, about 100
                  people gathered at Burr Oak Lodge in Glouster, Ohio to hear stories about the creature in the forest. Doug Waller, the author of four books of accounts of Sasquatch encounters, was the featured speaker. Waller
                  founded the Southeastern Ohio Society for Bigfoot Investigation to host a forum for believers and those who have had encounters with Sasquatch.
